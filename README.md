# Git Commit Message Generator

A smart Git commit message generator powered by Google's Gemini AI that analyzes your staged changes and recent commit history to create well-formatted, conventional commit messages.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Google Gemini to understand your code changes
- üìù **Conventional Commits**: Generates properly formatted commit messages following industry standards
- üîç **Context Aware**: Analyzes both your diff and recent git history for consistent style
- ‚ö° **Fast & Lightweight**: Simple Go binary with minimal dependencies
- üéØ **Detailed Messages**: Creates both concise subject lines and informative commit bodies

## How It Works

1. Analyzes your `git diff --staged` (your staged changes)
2. Reviews your recent git log to match your project's commit style
3. Uses Google's Gemini AI to generate a complete commit message with:
   - Proper subject line with conventional commit format
   - Detailed body explaining what, how, and why
   - Consistent tone matching your project's history

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- Git repository
- Google AI API key ([Get one here](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd go-google-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Set up your Google AI API key:

```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Option 2: Create .env file
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

4. Build the binary:

```bash
go build -o commit-gen main.go
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Stage your changes:

```bash
git add .
```

2. Generate commit message:

```bash
./commit-gen
```

3. Use the output for your commit:

```bash
git commit -m "$(./commit-gen)"
```

### Example Output

```
feat(auth): add JWT-based user authentication

- Implement JWT token generation and validation
- Add middleware for protecting authenticated routes  
- Create user login/logout endpoints with secure session handling

This change enables secure user sessions and replaces the previous
cookie-based authentication which had security vulnerabilities.
The new system provides better scalability and follows industry
best practices for API authentication.
```

### Integration Ideas

**Git Alias** (recommended):

```bash
git config --global alias.smart-commit '!git commit -m "$(./commit-gen)"'
# Usage: git smart-commit
```

**Git Hook**: Add to `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg` for automatic suggestions

**IDE Integration**: Use as external tool in VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.

## Configuration

The AI prompt is currently embedded in the code but follows these rules:

- **Subject line**: `type(scope): description` (max 50 chars)
- **Types**: feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs, style, test, perf, ci, build
- **Body**: Explains what, how, and why (wrapped at 72 chars)

## Error Handling

- **No staged changes**: The tool will prompt you to stage changes first
- **No API key**: Clear error message with setup instructions  
- **No git history**: Falls back to example commit formats
- **API timeout**: 10-second timeout prevents hanging
